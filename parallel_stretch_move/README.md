# Parallel Stretch Move Algorithm

## Description
This project implements the parallel version of the stretch move algorithm which is an improved version of the Metropolis Hastings algorithm. It is designed to draw walkers from a complementary ensemble using a bi-variate normal distribution. For further reading concerning this algorithm:
